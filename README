               OpenDNS Automated Black/White−list Management(Add/Delete) Utility

       Background
		OpenDNS Basic provides a cool way to control the home nework access restrictions.
	 	See http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxCH4VJ7az8 for a quick start guide.

		The service allows one to manage Blacklist/Whitelist manually via website.
		The "odns" automation Perl script allows one to schedule the changes.

       Add to Blacklist
                 % odns action=a_blacklist domain=facebook.com
                 2012−01−27T17:14:36     SUCCESS − action: a_blacklist, domain: facebook.com (100046) − Domain(s) successfully added to blocklist; will take effect in 3 minutes.

                 Add the specified domain to Blacklist

       Delete from Blacklist
                 % odns action=d_blacklist domain=facebbok.com
                 2012−01−27T17:15:59     SUCCESS − action: d_blacklist, domain: facebook.com (100046) − Domain(s) successfully removed from blocklist; will take effect in 3 minutes.

                 Delete the specified domain to Blacklist

       Description
                 'username' and 'password' info for login to opendns.com can be specified
                         either in a odns.conf file (same location as 'odns' utility),
                          or on the commandline.

                 Allowed values for 'action' are:
                         a_blacklist             => Add to Blacklist
                         d_blacklist             => Delete from Blacklist
                         a_whitelist             => Add to Whitelist
                         d_whitelist             => Delete from Whitelist

                 'domain' should be valid DNS name

       Sample Usage
		To block facebook.com over the week, making exceptions 7pm-8pm on weekdays and 
		allowing access over the weekend, one would setup a crontab as follows:

		0 19 * * 0-5	(cd /Users/.../odns/; ./odns action=d_blacklist domain=facebook.com)
		0 20 * * 0-4	(cd /Users/.../odns/; ./odns action=a_blacklist domain=facebook.com)
